# Project Progress

## What Works

### Core Functionality
- ✅ User authentication via Google OAuth
- ✅ Event creation and management
- ✅ RSVP generation with unique codes
- ✅ QR code generation for RSVPs
- ✅ RSVP response collection
- ✅ Basic RSVP tracking

### User Interface
- ✅ Responsive design with Bootstrap
- ✅ Event listing and detail views
- ✅ RSVP form with multiple options
- ✅ Thank you page after RSVP submission
- ✅ Improved navigation between events and RSVPs
- ✅ Consistent editing interface for events and RSVPs
- ✅ Single-page event management interface
- ✅ Single-page RSVP management interface
- ✅ Print-friendly QR code visualization page
- ✅ User-friendly RSVP response form

### Technical Implementation
- ✅ Database models and relationships
- ✅ Template rendering system
- ✅ Session management
- ✅ Docker containerization
- ✅ RESTful API structure with query parameters
- ✅ Resource-oriented handler organization
- ✅ Event model duration calculation for UI template integration
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite organized by functional areas
- ✅ Proper cleanup of temporary test databases in integration tests
- ✅ Moved integration tests to project root for better organization
- ✅ Restructured tests to be individually runnable without wrapper functions
- ✅ Eliminated code duplication in tests with shared test utilities
- ✅ Centralized test user data for consistency across tests
- ✅ Removed redundant test wrapper functions
- ✅ Consistent and descriptive variable naming in test files

## What's In Progress

### Code Quality Refactoring
- 🔄 Integration testing implementation without mocks
- 🔄 Replacing short variable names with descriptive ones
- 🔄 Implementing proper error handling throughout the codebase
- 🔄 Moving string literals to constants
- ✅ Implementing generic resource router to standardize routing
- ✅ Creating base handler framework to reduce code duplication
- ✅ Refactoring handlers to use the base handler framework
- ✅ Improving integration tests to work with refactored code
- ✅ Removing redundant authentication checks and standardizing authentication handling

### Features
- 🔄 Email notifications for RSVP responses
- 🔄 Enhanced RSVP statistics
- 🔄 Data export functionality

### Improvements
- 🔄 Mobile experience optimization
- 🔄 Performance enhancements

## What's Left to Build

### Major Features
- ❌ Event customization options
- ❌ Multiple event types
- ❌ Advanced analytics dashboard
- ❌ Calendar integration
- ❌ Recurring events support

### Technical Debt
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite
- ❌ API documentation
- ❌ Logging and monitoring
- ❌ CI/CD pipeline
- ❌ Database migration system (instead of dropping tables)
- ❌ Cross-event RSVP code uniqueness validation

## Known Issues

### Bugs
1. RSVP codes are not checked for uniqueness across events (only within the RSVP table)
2. Database is reset on every application start (tables are dropped and recreated)
3. Session timeout handling needs improvement
4. Form validation is minimal

### Limitations
1. No email integration for sending invites
2. Limited customization options for events
3. No bulk RSVP creation
4. No search functionality for RSVPs

## Success Metrics

### Current Status
- **Events Created**: Initial testing phase
- **RSVPs Generated**: Initial testing phase
- **RSVP Completion Rate**: Not yet measured
- **User Retention**: Not yet measured

### Goals
- **Events Created**: 100+ in first month after launch
- **RSVPs Generated**: 1000+ in first month
- **RSVP Completion Rate**: >80%
- **User Retention**: >60% after 3 months
